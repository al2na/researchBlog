I am currently a PostDoctoral Scholar in Bioinformatics working in the [Center for Environmental Systems Biochemistry in the Markey Cancer Center](http://cesb.uky.edu) at the University of Kentucky. My research areas are transcriptomics and metabolomics, with particular emphasis on error analysis and combining the data types.

Prior to this, I worked with Eric Rouchka on transcriptomics analysis. My PhD work was on constructing a workflow for using Weighted Alternating Least Squares to deconstruct transcriptomics time-series data. I have also worked in computer-aided drug design.

I started writing code in `MatLab` in 2004, and in 2010 switched to `R` and have never looked back. I've written one public  [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org) package [1](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/categoryCompare.html), [2](https://github.com/rmflight/categoryCompare), and am working on many others that will hopefully make it into the wild.

My primary interests involve any kind of high-throughput biological analysis, and especially methods to make sense of them. I am particularly interested in how we use visualization to enhance the analysis of high-throughput data. In addition, I think we need to change how we **do** and **communicate** science, and that the scientific process needs to be more open.
