# Adding things to the site
  
In addition to working with David on [`samatha`](https://github.com/DASpringate/samatha) and testing, I took some time today to add my [twitter](https://twitter.com/rmflight) feed and [disqus](http://disqus.com) comments. Those were the major elements I wanted to add to the blog. If you visit often, I would expect to see changes for the next little while as I get stuff worked out. Note that I don't think I have RSS figured out yet, will work on that sometime soon.
