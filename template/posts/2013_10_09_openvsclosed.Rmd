# Open VS Closed

This was sparked by a comment on twitter suggesting that data scientists and analysts need to be *polyglots*, that they should know more than **one** programming language or analysis framework. The commenter suggested knowing at least two of:

* R
* Python
* Matlab
* SPSS
* SAS
* Julia
* Octave

My comment back was that one should really evaluate whether SPSS, SAS and Matlab should be on this list, as they are *closed* languages, not open source. I want to expand on *why* I made that comment. Let me be forthright, I have not used SPSS, nor SAS, but I have programmed in MatLab and R extensively.
