# Detecting Dementia by Longitudinal Texts

A lot of people don't write much, but there are two groups of people who write a lot: scientists, and programmers. Could we use machine learning to detect the onset of dementia in individuals in these groups based on their public writing?

I don't have time or ability to do this, but hopefully this will reach someone who does.
