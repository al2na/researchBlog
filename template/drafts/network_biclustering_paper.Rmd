# Network-Assisted Co-Clustering for Cancer SubTypes

Issues with this paper:

MAD factor for the weights is generated from the same data the is used for biclustering
  This is probably the biggest problem. Weights come from the same data that subsequently gets clustered.
  
Given the results that incorporating the network weights improve the results only marginally, one wonders why to use them at all. This may be due to the MAD or the fact that the gene regulatory and protein interaction network is used. It is difficult to determine if different types of networks may be more useful than others. From the paper, it is difficult to determine what exactly the network data sources were, and how they were processed.
