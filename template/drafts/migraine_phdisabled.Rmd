# Being a PhD Student and PostDoc with Migraines

A blog post on the [Weecology group blog](http://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2014/10/13/how-technology-can-help-scientists-with-chronic-illnesses-or-technology-ftw/) by [Elita Baldridge](https://twitter.com/elitabaldridge) on being a PhD student with fibromyalgia, and how they are working through that, caused me to pause and reflect on my experience as a PhD and PostDoc with migraines.

For those who don't know, migraines are a rather unusual neurological event that result in a bunch of symptoms, the most well known generally being aura (frequently visual, although auditory and olfactory are also known) followed by what is described as intense, debilitating pain, which may or may not be accompanied by extreme nauseau and / or vomiting and tiredness.
