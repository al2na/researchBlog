# Being a PhD Student and PostDoc with Migraines

A blog post on the [Weecology group blog](http://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2014/10/13/how-technology-can-help-scientists-with-chronic-illnesses-or-technology-ftw/) by [Elita Baldridge](https://twitter.com/elitabaldridge) on being a PhD student with fibromyalgia, and how they are working through that, caused me to pause and reflect on my experience as a PhD and PostDoc with migraines.

## Migraine

For those who don't know, migraines are a rather unusual neurological event that result in a bunch of symptoms, the most well known generally being aura (frequently visual, although auditory and olfactory are also known) followed by what is described as intense, debilitating pain, which may or may not be accompanied by extreme nauseau and / or vomiting and tiredness.

## My Migraines

I have suffered from migraines since at least my early teens (possibly younger), but mine seem to be rather mild in comparison to what I have read about others experiences. In contrast to many other migraineurs, I do not experience visual aura, and in general my pain levels tend to be on the milder side. However, I do experience mood swings during my prodrome (period prior to pain), going from a generally nice guy to someone who considers killing you just for looking at me wrong; I also experience [expressive aphasia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphasia), wherein I can no longer remember proper nouns, but can describe properties of the object in question (for example, instead of a pencil, I might say the writing implement with lead). In addition to the pain of the migraine, which is often a pounding localized to one location of my skull, I often also experience extreme sensitivity to touch, to the point of not being able to sleep on a few occasions.

As far as I can tell, my primary migraine trigger is changes in the weather, either from nice to nasty, or even in the other direction. If the weather is stable (either nice or bad), the frequency and severity of my migraines are greatly reduced.

During my undergraduate and masters degrees, I actually didnt notice
