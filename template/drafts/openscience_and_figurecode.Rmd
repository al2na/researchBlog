# Making code available to reproduce figures

Recently a group made a really slick point and click interface for producing boxplots using R and Shiny. Some have made fun of it because it made it into Nature Methods, but considering how important boxplots are to interpreting and communicating biological results, I think it is good that the authors have provided an interface that allows others without R knowledge to produce nice looking plots. 

## But ...

There is a **but** here. What if, in 3 months (or 6, or 12) the reviews come back, and the reviewers complain about the figure, and this or that option should be changed. Or someone else comes along and wants to verify that the way the figure was produced from the data was proper?
